# ProtoVR
A VR control app for Proto

Displays 2 camera streams side by side to make it look like real while phone is inside the VR headset. Gyroscopic inputs have
to be used to know whether the user is looking up or down. Left or right movements for camera would be same as turning left or
right which are done using the same controller used to control the bot

First stage: Get the simple VR app without gyroscopic movements

Second Stage: Get Gyroscopic movements working. Might also have to channge Swiffee code plus find a way to convey these inputs
to the bot

Third stage: Connect the controller directly to phone and send all inputs from the phone
